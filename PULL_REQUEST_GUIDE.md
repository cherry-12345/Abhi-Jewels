# Pull Request Guide

## 🎯 Creating a Pull Request

Since you've already pushed to the main branch, here's how to create a proper pull request workflow for future changes:

## Option 1: Create PR from Current Changes (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create a Feature Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch from the previous commit
git checkout -b feature/bug-fixes c5bac7e

# Cherry-pick the bug fix commit
git cherry-pick c7178b8

# Push the feature branch
git push origin feature/bug-fixes
```

### Step 2: Create Pull Request on GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/cherry-12345/Abhi-Jewels
2. Click "Pull requests" tab
3. Click "New pull request"
4. Select:
   - Base: `main`
   - Compare: `feature/bug-fixes`
5. Fill in the PR template below

## Option 2: Future Pull Request Workflow

### For New Features/Fixes
```bash
# 1. Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Your feature description"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Create PR on GitHub
# Go to repository and click "Compare & pull request"
```

## 📊 Current Repository Status

```
Repository: https://github.com/cherry-12345/Abhi-Jewels
Branch: main
Latest Commit: c7178b8
Status: ✅ All checks passing
Build: ✅ Successful
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Branch Naming
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Urgent fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation updates

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits:
```
feat: Add new feature
fix: Fix bug
docs: Update documentation
style: Format code
refactor: Refactor code
test: Add tests
chore: Update dependencies
```

### PR Size
- Keep PRs small and focused
- One feature/fix per PR
- Easier to review and merge

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### PR Conflicts
```bash
# Update your branch with latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "Merge main into feature branch"
git push origin your-branch
```

### Failed CI Checks
1. Check the error logs in GitHub Actions
2. Fix issues locally
3. Commit and push fixes
4. CI will automatically re-run

### Reverting Changes
```bash
# Revert last commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin your-branch

# Reset to previous commit (use carefully)
git reset --hard commit-hash
git push origin your-branch --force
```
