#### Test TC010
- **Test Name:** Responsive design across devices and screen sizes
- **Test Code:** [TC010_Responsive_design_across_devices_and_screen_sizes.py](./TC010_Responsive_design_across_devices_and_screen_sizes.py)
- **Test Error:** The platform UI was verified on the desktop viewport and found to render and function correctly with the luxury color palette and typography. Navigation menus, product listings, and interactive elements are accessible and styled consistently. Due to limitations in switching viewports within the current environment, mobile and tablet viewport tests could not be fully completed. Therefore, the task is partially complete with desktop verification successful but mobile and tablet responsiveness not fully validated.

#### Test TC015

- **Test Error:** I have logged in as admin and explored the admin panel and homepage but could not find any UI options to run tests or view coverage reports. Attempts to navigate to a terminal or command line interface within the app failed. Please confirm if running the unit, integration, and end-to-end tests externally via command line or CI/CD pipeline is acceptable, so I can assist accordingly.
